# Explaining the annotations in this 'Python' folder

Here I will not write down the basics about int, float or String.
The information will start from topic 4 of the documentation.

> If you want to see something about it, I recommend reading the documentation: **[topic_3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)**

I will try to write everything important in the documentation, with explanations and examples, bringing together topics that I think are important and that complement each other

My goal is to read all the relevant part of the documentation
of Python to obtain detailed knowledge of the language, taking notes and practicing in the files below

> even serving to facilitate future research until you memorize them

So... what will you find in each file?
