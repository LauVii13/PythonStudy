This is all my python study, started on 5th of July(2022), from the basic of the language to the development of A.I, applications and other things.

The list of videos I used to learn that language: -> (Programming with Mosh) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc

So here, I will post all the activities I'm going to do to practice Python, both from the videos in question and extra activities

Organization of folder contents:

- Starting Python: 'Program with Mosh' video
- Python: documentation study (https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Beecrowd: plataform with programming challenges to study (in the future, I will change to LeetCode)
