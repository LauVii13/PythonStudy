This is all my python study, started on 5th of July(2022), from the basic of the language to the development of A.I, applications and other things.

The list of videos I used to learn that language:

- [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)

<br>
So here, I will post all the activities I'm going to do to practice Python, both from the videos in question and extra activities

Organization of folder contents:

- **Starting Python**: ['Program with Mosh' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
- **Python**: [documentation study](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- **Beecrowd**: platform with programming challenges to study (in the future, I will change to LeetCode)
- **Codeforces**: participating in contests and solving old problems (from the easiest to the most difficult)
- **VJudge**: Solving lists of questions from the 'AA' subject (Advanced Algorithms - basic level) at UFCG (Federal University of Campina Grande)
  > All solved exercises are listed in folder ['Questions'](Questions)
